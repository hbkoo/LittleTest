## Abstract



## Contribution

- We propose the RFB module to simulate the configuration in terms of the size and eccentricity of RFs in human visual systems, aiming to enhance deep features of lightweight CNN networks.
提出一个RFB模型，模拟人类视觉系统中的感受野的大小个离心率，旨在利用轻量级的卷积神经网络增强深度特征。
- We present the RFB Net based detector, and by simply replacing the top convolution layers of SSD with RFB, it shows significant performance gain while still keeping the computational cost under control.
我们提出一个基于RFB网络的检测器，仅仅把SSD的上面的几层卷积层用RFB代替，就会有很好的变现并且计算量可以控制。
- We show that RFB Net achieves state-of-the-art results on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO at a real time processing speed, and demonstrate the generalization ability of RFB by linking it to MobileNet.
RFB网络在Pascal VOC和COCO数据集上实现了最好的效果，并且速度很快。
